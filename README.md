## Understanding Customer Behaviour under Interest Rate Changes

### Description
Under Basel II regulation banks need to understand the financial risk related to changes in the economy. One particular change is in interest rates. A bankâ€™s income depends significantly on the interest on a range of products, including loans, mortgages, deposits and so on. If the interest rate increase customers might elect to pay off loans early, or change their mortgage from a variable rate to a fixed rate. In order to model the effect of the change, a bank needs to understand how customers will respond. This can be fed into a large calculation, including the predicted future interest rates (yield curve) in order to compute the expected change in income to the bank related to the change in interest rates. Different countries have different cultures with regards to borrowing and saving. Therefore the above market segmentation will strongly depend on cultural factors also.
